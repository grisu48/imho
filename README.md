IsMyHackerspaceOpen Python script. Queries the currently
hardcoded IT-Syndikat Hackerspace API if it is open.

Based on the idea of Robelix' imho https://github.com/robelix/imho


Usage
=====

`git clone https://github.com/grisu48/imho.git`

`python isitopen.py`

Consider installing it, then you can use it system-wide with `isITopen`. With `isITopen URL` you can access any custom URL, that implements the isitopen API.

Install
=======

`make install`
